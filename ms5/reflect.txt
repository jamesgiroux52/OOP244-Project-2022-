 OOP244 - Final Project Reflection
**********************************************/

When the semester began, the last time I wrote any code was at the end of 2019. It's not like I forgot programming logic, but I definitely had a lot to refresh. I must have spent two days completing the first workshop. Only through pure will and determination was I able to come so far this semester. I also love coding, although sometimes it feels like you are smacking your head against a wall. But I love solving problems, so it wasn't that bad. I hope my classmates who haven't done very well in this course commit to trying again because it is absolutely worth it.
Throughout writing the project milestones, I spent many, many hours debugging. Debugging helped me to learn all the concepts even better, and I feel very confident about next semester's C++ class.
All the concepts I learned in this class will help me become a better programmer and also help me learn other object-oriented languages.
Understanding polymorphism, inheritance, how to manage memory, and templates have given me a solid foundation to complete this program and beyond. 
Thank you, Nargis. It was a pleasure to know you.
